Kesamutti Sutta

Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing (anussava),
* nor upon tradition (paramparā),
* nor upon rumor (itikirā),
* nor upon what is in a scripture (piṭaka-sampadāna)
* nor upon surmise (takka-hetu),
* nor upon an axiom (naya-hetu),
* nor upon specious reasoning (ākāra-parivitakka),
* nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over (diṭṭhi-nijjhān-akkh-antiyā),
* nor upon another's seeming ability (bhabba-rūpatāya),
* nor upon the consideration, The monk is our teacher (samaṇo no garū)
* Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.
