Thoughts are friends not enemies.  They're just what is.  They appear.  They are innocent.  We're not doing them.  They're not personal.  They are like the breeze or the leaves on the trees or the raindrops falling.  Thoughts arise like that, and we can make friends with them.  Would you argue with a raindrop? Raindrops aren't personal, and neither are thoughts.  It's the meaning you attach to those thoughts that you think is personal. Inquire.  Meet them with understanding.  Once a painful concept is met with understanding, the next time it appears you may find it interesting.  What used to be the nightmare is now just interesting.  The next time it appears, you may find it funny.  The next time you may not even notice it. There will be no attachment.  I meet thoughts the way I would meet my children.  I meet them with love, gentleness, and a quiet understanding.

-- Byron Katie
