To think that you know what's best for another person is to be out of your business.  The result is worry, anxiety, and fear.  When you mentally step out of your business, you think that you know more than he, she, or God.  The only real question is "Can I know what's right for myself?"  That is your only business. And, as you eventually come to see, not even that. 

-- Byron Katie
