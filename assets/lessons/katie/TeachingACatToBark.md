If you want reality to be different than it is, you might as well try to teach a cat to bark.  You can try and try and in the end the cat will look up at you and say, "Meow."  Wanting reality to be different than it is is hopeless.  You can spend the rest of your life trying to teach a cat to bark.

-- Byron Katie
