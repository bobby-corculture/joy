Fear has only two causes: the thought of losing what you have or the thought of not getting what you want.  In either case, the worst thing that can ever happen is a story.  Nothing you need can be taken from you.  And no one can ever have anything you need.  Need is a story you tell yourself.  It's a lie that causes you pain and separates you from yourself.  It's wanting what is not that separates you from what is.  

-- Byron Katie
