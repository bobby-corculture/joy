Self meeting itself - that's the deal.  If I wait for God to enlighten me, it could be a very long wait – years decades maybe. When I'm on my knees praying to God in all sincerity, I'm the one listening.  Can I do what I’ve begged God to do? Can I hear myself? Who else is listening? I'm a lover of reality.  Can I just listen to myself? And when I hear myself, there's no separation.  If I want God to do something, I turn it around.  And in the peace of that, I come to know the truth.

-- Byron Katie
