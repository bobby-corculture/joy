People talk about self-realization, and this is it!  Can you just breathe in and out?  To hell with enlightenment! Just enlighten yourself in this moment. Can you just do that?  And then, eventually, it all collapses.  The mind finds a home in the heart.  The mind merges with the heart and comes to see that it's not separate.  It finds a home and it rests.  It can't.  It can't be threatened or scolded or frightened away.   Until the story is met with understanding, there is no peace.  Only love and understanding heal.

-- Byron Katie
