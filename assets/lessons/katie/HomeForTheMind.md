We buy a home for our children, for our bodies; we get a garage for our car; we have doghouses for our dogs; but we wonâ€™t give the mind a home.  We treat it like an outcast.  We shame it and blame it and shame it again.  But if you let the mind ask its questions, then the heart will reveal the answers.  Then the mind can finally rest at home in the heart and come to see that it and the heart are one.

-- Byron Katie
