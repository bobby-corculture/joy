Open your senses, giving equal importance to everything. Let go of any meanings you're assigning based on your life experience or predisposition. Feel your clothes on your skin. See everything without focusing on, or giving meaning to, any one thing. Let all sound and smells in. Be open to the sensations in your abdomen, whatever they are - warmth, tension, emptiness, whatever.
