Whatever you are doing, do it for the sake of doing it, without thought of gain. If youâ€™re walking, be the best walker you can be. Clean the teapot as if you were washing the baby Buddha. Every action, every object, every person is sacred. Let go of your grasping mind - let go of trying to have some thing or person, or to cause some result.
