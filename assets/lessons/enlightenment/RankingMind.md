Notice when how your mind ranks things - this is better than that. Let it go. One thing is not better than another thing; each thing just is. You cover up the true nature of things with judgments of what is superior, and you cover up your own true nature.

No thing is better than, worse than, or the same as another thing. Each thing is itself. It's in your nature to promote some things rather than others; this is right. Simultaneously, each thing is only itself, incomparable with anything else.
